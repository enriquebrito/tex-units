% To be able to process this file with a script to automatically generate the
% different versions, we define two variable with \def when compiling, like in
%    pdflatex "\def\LANGUAGE{english}\def\COLORMODEL{rgb}\input{tex-units}"
% if we compile the usual way instead, we provide these variables:
\providecommand{\LANGUAGE}{spanish}% language: 'ngerman' or 'english'
\providecommand{\COLORMODEL}{rgb}% color model: 'rgb' or 'gray'
% We use the variable as class options. YOu may replace them with an appropriate
% value.
\documentclass[
   \LANGUAGE,
   \COLORMODEL,
]{scrartcl}

% LOAD DEFINITIONS
\input{header}

% LANGUAGE VARIABLES
% To be able to switch the language easily, we define some variables in different
% language files. If the language is ngerman we load the corresponding file:
\iflanguage{ngerman}{
   \input{content-variables-ngerman}
}{}
\iflanguage{spanish}{
   \input{content-variables-spanish}
}{}
% However we load the english variable in every case to make sure to have the
% variables defined even in unkown languages:
\input{content-variables-english}
% inside of this file we use \providecommand to define the variables so we don't
% overwrite the definitions of other languages.
